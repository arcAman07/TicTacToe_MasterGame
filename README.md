## Features
<h3>This Tic-Tac-Toe game currently has three game modes:</h3>
  <h4>
    1) 1 v 1 against a human player with inbuilt scoreboard system which keeps on updating as the game progresses, cool animations, an alert system (toast) which alerts players about the outcome of the game as it is finished and users can continue the battle by clicking the Play Again button as the game finishes.</h4>

    <h4>
    2) 1 v 1 Custom Game Modes: These Custom Game Modes are shown as below. In each of these game mode the games will last 10,15 or 20 seconds as per the user's choice. </h4>

  <h4>As soon as the user presses the START Button the game and the timer automatically starts.</h4>

  <h4>As soon as the game finishes the timer stops automatically, updating the scoreboard and alerting the winner of the game as a toast message.</h4>

  <h4> If the game is not finished and the time runs out, then the game will be considered a Draw and scoreboard will be accordingly updated. The user will be prompted to PLAY AGAIN or return to the HOME PAGE.</h4>

## Tech Stack
 <h4> 
  1)Built entirely using Android Studio. <br>
  2)Plan to use SQLite/mongodb database to store the game played by the user and connecting it to a node server(using Express.js framework).<br>
  3)Tensorflow to build a ML model around the game which can be used by the computer engine.<br>

 ## Future Enhancements
  <h4>
  1) Improvement in the UI of the application.<br>
  2) Adding custom User input game modes where users can set the duration of the game.<br>
  3) Using mongodb/SQLite database to store the games and handling that data with node server(using Express.js)
  4) Training a ML model using neural network from the games and corresponding resullts collected(dynamic model).
  5) Implementing a computer engine mode based on
