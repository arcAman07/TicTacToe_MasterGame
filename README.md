 ## Tech Stack
 <h4> 
  1)Built entirely using Android Studio. <br>
  2)Plan to use SQLite/mongodb database to store the game played by the user and connecting it to a node server(using Express.js framework).<br>
  3)Tensorflow to build a ML model around the game which can be used by the computer engine.<br>
